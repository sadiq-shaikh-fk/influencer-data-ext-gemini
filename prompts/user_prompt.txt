Instructions:
STEP 1 - Real Name Search: For each channel_title, perform a web search:
Search for "[channel_title] real name" or "[channel_title] YouTuber real name"
Look for biographical information about the person behind the channel
Examples: "CarryMinati real name" → "Ajey Nagar", "MrBeast real name" → "Jimmy Donaldson"
If found: Use real name for inf_name
If NOT found: Use cleaned channel_title for inf_name
STEP 2 - Contact Extraction: For each channel_desc, extract contact information:
Email: Look for email patterns (contains @, valid domains)
Phone: Look for phone patterns (+91, Indian mobile numbers, international formats)
Common locations: "Business inquiries:", "Contact:", "Email:", "For collaborations:"
If found: Use extracted values for inf_email and inf_phone1
If NOT found: Set to null
STEP 3 - Gender Prediction: Analyze all available data for gender indicators:
Sources: Real name, channel_desc, channel_keywords, channel_summary
Indicators: Name patterns, pronouns, content themes, explicit mentions
Score confidence (0.0 to 1.0) based on strength of evidence
If confidence > 0.5: Use predicted gender ("Male", "Female", "Other")
If confidence ≤ 0.5: Set to null
STEP 4 - City Prediction: Analyze location indicators:
Base context: Use channel_country as starting point
Sources: channel_desc, channel_keywords, channel_summary
Indicators: "Based in [city]", "[city] based", local references, area mentions
Score confidence (0.0 to 1.0) based on explicitness of location mentions
If confidence > 0.5: Use predicted city name (Title Case format)
If confidence ≤ 0.5: Set to null
Process each channel record from the provided data
Map the channel_id to inf_pk_id for platform reference
Set inf_primary_platform_id to the appropriate YouTube platform ID
Apply all default values as specified in the system prompt
Return ONLY the JSON array - no additional text or formatting
Important: Be conservative with predictions. Only include gender/city when you have strong, clear evidence (confidence > 0.5).
Important: Ensure the JSON is valid and ready for direct database insertion into the influencers table.
